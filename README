monfetch
--------

a remote system monitoring tool based on the conecpt of fetch programs.

monfetch is a client-server program to remotely and centrally monitor
servers. the agent fetches information in a classic UNIX fetch program
style and POSTs the collected information to a remote server.
The remote server will then collect that information and display it in
a way similar to those fetch programs, but on a web interface.
